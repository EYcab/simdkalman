### SIMD Kalman

Fast-ish Kalman filters in Python leveraging single-instruction multiple-data
vectorization. That is, running _n_ similar Kalman filters on _n_
independent series of observations. Not to be confused with SIMD processor
instructions.

See `example.py`.

TODO: among others, documentation and more standard nomenclature
